### Getting Started

We provide a vagrant file for easy dev environment creation. Install
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and on the main directory run:

    vagrant up

Them you just need to go inside the machine to start the dev server:

    vagrant ssh

On the VM console:

    ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Now the system is running, you can go to `http://localhost:8000` on your web
browser and navigate on it.
To create a new superuser (so you can give permissions to other make other users professors) run:

    ./manage.py createsuperuser

See the Vagrantfile and script folder for more details.

## Running Tests

We made a bunch of tests for the system. They are separated into python tests
(that includes selenium full stack tests) and Karma/AngularJS tests. To run all
of them together just type

    make all_tests

remember that you need to have your virtualenv activated and has installed
everything from the `dev-requirements.txt` file.

### python

Activate virtual env, then:

    make python_tests

### Angular

In the root of repository:

    make karma_tests
